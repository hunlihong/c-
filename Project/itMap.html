              A computer science major is a degree program that focuses on the
              theoretical and practical aspects of computing. Computer science
              majors learn about computer hardware, software, and algorithms.
              They also learn about the principles of problem-solving and how to
              design and implement solutions using computers. A computer science
              major can be a great choice for people who are interested in
              technology, problem-solving, and creativity. Computer science
              majors have a variety of career options available to them,
              including software development, data science, artificial
              intelligence, and cybersecurity.

              Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems and
              networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
              modification, or destruction. It includes a wide range of
              activities, such as:
              <li>
                Preventing cyberattacks: This involves identifying and
                mitigating vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Detecting cyberattacks: This involves monitoring computer
                systems and networks for signs of unauthorized activity.
              </li>
              <li>
                to cyberattacks: This involves taking steps to contain the
