        <h3>What is Information Technology?</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          An information technology (IT) major is a degree program that focuses
          on the study of computers, information systems, and
          telecommunications. IT majors learn how to design, develop, and manage
          information systems that support business operations. They also learn
          about the ethical and legal issues related to the use of technology.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-child">
        <h3>Why should be IT?</h3>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          There are some reasons that IT should be chosen to study as a major
          nowadays:
          <li>
            High demand: The demand for IT professionals is high and is expected
            to continue to grow in the coming years. According to the Bureau of
            Labor Statistics, employment of computer and information technology
            occupations is projected to grow 13% from 2020 to 2030, much faster
            than the average for all occupations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variety of career options: There are many different IT careers to
            choose from, so you can find one that is a good fit for your skills
            and interests. Some of the most popular IT careers include software
            developer, systems administrator, network engineer, IT security
            analyst, and database administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good salary: IT professionals typically earn a good salary.
            According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage
            for computer and information technology occupations was $91,250 in
            May 2020.
          </li>
          <li>
            Job security: IT jobs are relatively recession-proof. This is
            because businesses need IT professionals to keep their systems
            running and their data secure, even during economic downturns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upward mobility: There are many opportunities for advancement in the
            IT field. As you gain experience and skills, you can move into more
